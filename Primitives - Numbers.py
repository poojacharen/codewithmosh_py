# Numbers
# In python there are 3 types of numbers
# 145 - Integer
# 1.45 - Float
# a + bi - Complex numbers, where i is the imaginary number

x = 12
x = 1.45
x = 1 + 2j # instead of i we use j

# Arithmetic Operators
print(20 + 3)
print(20 - 3)
print(20 * 3)
print(20 / 3) # we get the output with floating point number
print(20 // 3) # we get the output with an integer
print(20 % 3) # modulus - the remainder of the division
print(20 ** 3) # exponent - power

# We also have Augmented Assignment Operator

x = 10
x = x + 3

# or use augmented assignment operator
x += 3
