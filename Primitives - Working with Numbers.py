# Working with Numbers

# round(2.6) # rounding a number

print(round(2.6)) # output is 3

# Another built-in function called
abs(-2.6) # which gives the absolute value
print(abs(-2.6)) # output is 2.6 (gives a positive value)

# If you want to write a program that involves complex mathematical calculations, we need to use math module
# A module is like a separate file with some python code.
# Math module in pyhon includes lot of mathematical functions for working with numbers
# But we need to import this module, so we can use it

import math  # math in this program is an obj, so we can use a .notation to see the functions more accurately and all the objs available in this obj

math.ceil(2.2) # to get a ceiling of a number
print(math.ceil(2.2)) # output : 3

# Refer google for more builtin function in math module
